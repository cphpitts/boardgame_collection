# Boardgame Collection Exercise
This application uses Django to manage a database for a board game collection. The app utilizes the API from [BoardGameGeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to search for the hottest games and scrapes the data to add to your collection. In addition, there is a web scraper directed at [diceTowerNews.com](https://www.dicetowernews.com/).

## Seed Database
Run `python manage.py loaddata seed/json`
